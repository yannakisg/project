Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge
=============

## File Structure

The folder "src" contains the source files ("src/dataengineering") as well as the compiled project ("src/dist/DataEngineering.jar") and the libraries that 
I used ("src/dist/lib/org.json"). 

Folder "src/test" contains some JUnit tests. 

The "src/DataEngineering_Netbeans.tar.gz" contains the whole Netbeans project.

In the "insight_testsuite" there is an additional test case created based on the example that was provided
 in the Coding Challenge github page.

## Details of Implementation

The implementation was done using Java SE JDK 8. In order for the project to be executed the version of the java
command should be above 1.8.
